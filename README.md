# biglight-toolkit (WIP)
The idea is to automate small daily tasks

#HOW TO RUN IT
Create a file and drop all your assets, even the images.
To convert .gifs to .mp4:
- Open the terminal
- Go to the folder where you have stored the assets
- Run _ bash convert.sh _

It will create an output directory with all the converted files.

#TODO
Create the menu with the options
Allow user to select flags and other values
Resize images as well if needed
