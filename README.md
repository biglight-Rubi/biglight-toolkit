# biglight-toolkit (WIP)
The idea is to automate small daily tasks

## HOW TO RUN IT
Create a folder and drop all your assets, even the images. Add this convert.sh file to that folder.
To convert .gifs to .mp4:
- Open the terminal
- Go to the folder where you have stored the assets
- Run _bash convert.sh_

It will create an output directory with all the converted files.

### TODO
Create the menu with the options
Allow user to select flags and other values
Resize images as well if needed
